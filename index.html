    <h1>Hey!</h1>
    <p>I am challenging myself by learning web development using a video course
      from udemy.com! Here I'll post links to different projects I've made during
      the course, with a little description. Like a portfolio! My projects become
      more and more advanced while following the course and putting the effort in
      understanding and using all the elements of web development that are being
      taught in the course.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Projects:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This is the first project i've created with this course</p>
        <p>This project contains only html scipt, and it's meant to learn
          different html elements.</p>
        <p>Link to the project: <a href="https://firstwebsite.thomasvlaming.tk">
